you'll see me chilling near docks most of the time alone, or sitting with friends/my fiance or two siblings.
</br>
character(s) i'm sitting with DOESN'T MEAN SHIPS!
</br>
i'm antisocial so i likely won't approach first and i suck at talking to people who aren't already my friends.
</br>
but if you want to be friends just ask me. genuinely hmu if you're a freak and a weirdo and you like offputting guys. ask for my disc.
</br> 
i use slurs i can reclaim but not too often. i appreciate tone tags, but let me know if you need them because i don't use them by default.
<br> 
feel free to cuddle, hide behind, kiss, etc. it's just pixels so i don't care.

â˜£ **people i don't want to be friends with:**
</br> here's some stuff i avoid or hide. i also hide freely. i don't unhide.
- MINORS
- tcc
- irl/delusionals, including anti-recovery of any sort.
- ponytown systems, sorry. just because i'm one doesn't automatically mean i want to be your friend.
- self diagnosers
- drama/cancel/callout people
- people in fandoms
  *sexualizing/watering down characters*
- you think liking edgy stuff automatically makes you evil
<br/> if this bothers you i don't care. i'm fine with getting blocked.
<br/>
