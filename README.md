i don't want to bother making this look nice because this is a ponytown specific page :P my main info page is [here](https://w0lf.straw.page).
if you whisper to me i MAY not get back to you so feel free to leave something on my retrospring.
*i come across as blunt a lot so i wouldn't recommend interacting if you're sensitive
or anything, i'm not out to get you lol.. if i was being mean on purpose you'd know anyway.
just ask if you're not sure.

there is no TLDR. vibes only. my accounts are on my strawpage directory.

i have a lot of worms in my brain and medically diagnosed disorders/illnesses. in case it wasn't already obvious..!
whatever avatar i am may or may not indicate whoever is fronting but it doesn't really matter unless you want to be buddies.
feel free to add me on discord if that's the case! it's wolfsdayoff.

you'll see me chilling near docks most of the time alone, or sitting with friends/my fiance. character(s) i'm sitting with DOESN'T MEAN SHIPS! i've always been guard dog privilege for my friends and i am possessive of them but not in the gross toxic way aehehehee. if i have you added and see you online i'll probably come sit with you, but i rarely engage in conversation if we aren't close. that doesn't mean i don't want to talk to you, though! i love having a chat. in public spaces such as ponytown, discord servers and the sort i'm mostly SEMIVERBAL!
feel free to cuddle, hide behind, kiss, etc. it's just pixels so i don't care.

if you have 'dni' in your name i'm DEFINITELY laughing at you. you can log off, yanno?

my main special interests are the legend of zelda, minecraft, and twenty one pilots. i've lived and breathed these things since i was a kid so i love talking about them/engaging with said things. my other interests are listed on my strawpage but they vary! keep in mind i DON'T participate in 'fandom' spaces anymore, including others who are actively in 'fandoms.' i'm old and the state of spaces on the internet has gone downhill rapidly. but if you're a freak about things in your own special way then i'd love to vibe.

things i really like doing and sharing are writing/roleplaying and art yay ...

i don't necessarily have a dni because i hide/block a LOT of people but if you're someone who is really into 'cancelling' or 'calling out' and shit i don't want anything to do with you. also, i don't encourage delusions/psychosis in any shape or form so people with 'irl' and of the sort i tend to avoid. i don't talk to self diagnosers. and if you think portraying yourself as edgy/liking dark fiction makes someone automatically evil, you're weird.
if we're talking already and i realize we won't get along i'll just let you know and unadd you. if you get mad at this then you need to sort your priorities.
if you've read all of this you get a gift \*hands you a slightly soggy cheeto*
