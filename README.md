 this is a ponytown specific page, my main info page is [here](https://w0lf.straw.page).
 <br/>
if you whisper to me i MAY not get back to you so, if you would like a reply, leave something on my guestbook.

<br/>

***☣ stuff to note***
<br/>
- i like sitting with strangers and not saying anything.
- i'm mostly semiverbal in public settings. yes this includes ponytown, sigh.
- int please if we share interests and you want an offputting dogbeast to haunt you forever. i have disorders that WILL affect the way i interact with you.
- you'll see me chilling near docks most of the time alone, or sitting with friends/my fiance or two siblings.
- character(s) i'm sitting with DOESN'T MEAN SHIPS!
- i use slurs i can reclaim but not too often. i appreciate tone tags, but let me know if you need them because i don't use them by default.
- cuddle, hide behind, kiss, etc. is fine with me. it's just pixels so i don't care. if my pony is a character you like especially, feel free to, i think it's cute.
<br/>

***☣ people i don't want to be friends with:***
</br> here's some stuff i avoid or hide. i also hide freely. i don't unhide.
- MINORS
- tcc
- irl/delusionals, including anti-recovery of any sort.
- ponytown systems, sorry. just because i'm one doesn't automatically mean i want to be your friend.
- self diagnosers
- drama/cancel/callout people
- people in fandoms
  *sexualizing/watering down characters*
- you think liking edgy stuff automatically makes you evil
<br/> if this bothers you i don't care. i'm fine with getting blocked.
